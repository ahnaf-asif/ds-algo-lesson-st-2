# Sessions for Lucyfox858

Each session comprises two segments: theory and problem-solving. We'll begin with an overview of data structures, algorithms, or specific techniques. This will be followed by a discussion on 2-3 problems (easy-medium-hard). You will also receive related assignments for further practice, and supplementary study materials as needed.

### Session 1: Complexity Analysis, Binary search
**Description:** The theory portion of this session is very short as complexity analysis or binary search are very preliminary ideas in terms of data structures and algorithms. We’ll solve at least 3-4 problems in this session, and also give a few problems in the exercise.

### Session 2: Stack, Queue, Deque
**Description:** The data structures themselves are very easy to implement, in fact, almost all modern languages (c++, java, python) have stack and queue built-in. However, it is quite common for interviewers to ask stack-queue-related hard problems. We’ll discuss multiple problems from Leetcode (easy, medium, and hard) and learn a few tricks to solve them.

### Session 3: Greedy, two-pointers
**Description:** I will show some greedy techniques like fractional knapsacks, sliding windows, etc. Greedy and two-pointer-related problems are often all about finding some key observations. I’ll show 3-4 problems and common techniques, and give a handful amount of problems as exercise.

### Session 4: BFS, DFS
**Description:** These are the two most used graph algorithms. Especially for trees, DFS is used in almost all advanced algorithms. The algorithms themselves are not that hard to understand, but many hard problems can be solved by them, so I’ll focus on that. I’ll show tons of different techniques, and then I’ll give a few exercise problems.


### Session 5: Mathematics
**Description:** Mathematics is the backbone of CS. I’ll show some common theories of computation (combinatorics, number theory, modular arithmetics). I’ll also show some bit manipulations and their applications.

### Session 6: Recursion, Dynamic Programming
**Description:** Dynamic programming is one of the most challenging topics for beginners as it is quite hard to visualize the optimizations. I’ll show the techniques of top-down and bottom-up dp, coin change, maximizing path values, some tree dp, etc. The only we to get better at DP is to practice a lot, so I’ll give plenty of practice problems, and discuss their solutions if needed.

### Session 7: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
**Description:** As we know, BFS for the shortest path only works on unweighted (or 0/1 weighted) graphs, for weighted graphs, we need to use Dijkstra, and then, if we have negative cycles, we might need to use Bellman-Ford or Floyd-Warshal. We will go through these algorithms, and then solve problems related to them. You’ll have tons of exercise problems.

### Session 8: Strings
**Description:** String problems are quite common in interview questions. I’ll show a few algorithms and data structures, for example, Trie, Knuth–Morris–Pratt, Rabin Karp, Z function, etc. I’ll show a few interesting problems that can be solved using those algorithms, and give a ton of practice problems for exercise. Even though it is for strings, it requires a good understanding of modular arithmetic and trees (especially for trie). It will open a wide range of problem-solving techniques.

### Session 9: RMQ techniques
**Description:** This is one of the most important sessions. We’ll learn range minimum query(rmq) techniques, for example, square-root decomposition, LCA techniques, segment tree, binary indexed tree, etc. This will be one of the longest sessions, and we’ll solve plenty of different problems.



### Session 10: Some Advanced graph algorithms
**Description:** In this session, I’ll go through some of the advanced graph algorithms, for example, topological sorting, strongly connected components, Articulation points, Articulation Bridges, etc. Then we will solve problems with them, and provide exercises.
